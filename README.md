Analyzing the impact of trade agreements using Machine Learning

• Evaluate the impact of trade agreements on trade flows with respect to provisions like competition policy,
trade related investment measures, anti dumping laws, etc.
• A Feature Selection problem - To select most important provisions and quantifying their impact on trade
flows between the agreement holding nations.
• To find out what provisions leads to the most enhancement of trade flows between the countries.
• Gained exposure to different Machine Learning techniques like Lasso regression, Iceberg Lasso, LSTM,
etc. The models built in Scikit-Learn and trained on the World Bank dataset on the Preferential Trade
Agreements 1964-2016.


I am currently working on this research project.
Will upload the analysis, code, datasets and paper soon.
